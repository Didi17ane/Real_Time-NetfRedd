18,"I have been a loyal Netflix Canada customer since 2013 and have enjoyed my subscription until now.  I have always thought that Netflix was innovative and cared about their customers.  It seems I was wrong and Netflix is the same as the big cable companies like Bell and Telus who do not care about their customers at all and money is the only thing that matters.  I am referring to the recent changes to the subscription plans available and the introduction of an Ad based plan.  I REFUSE and will NEVER pay for a service that includes ads.  The most valuable thing we have in life is time and I will not waste 1 second of my life watching ads.

I was shocked and angry that the only options to continue my subscription are to go to an ad based subscription or pay $6 to $7 more per month for the ad free plan.  Really?  They are both terrible and unacceptable options.  Why doesn't Netflix offer an annual ad free subscription for around $100 like other streaming services (Prime, Paramount+, Disney) ~particularly~ to your loyal customers like me.

As a result of this short sightedness and greed I no longer wish to subscribe to Netflix. 

I understand Netflix is a business and needs to make money, but I still have hope that there are companies out there that understand money can be made while being conscientious of their customer’s needs.

been using it for years and so far i love it on the profile, on the suggestions and list, and how it continues off whenever you left off that is what i love the best. but the slow talking is getting on my nerves and i lose concentration cant stay and focus on the show... end up dropping it or switching to another platform because i will want to know what happens. or it gets too slow and i say i comeback next time i throw it in the lazy watch bin....

been using it for i think since it started in Singapore.. and my plan is the max plan now with +2 user extended (i have to msg people too waste time to keep track on payment or i pay for everyone...) so if not worth my time anymore i thinking if i should just one less thing to do and pay..

Have a Netflix account with approx $200 gift card balance in it (added many years ago). The reason that didnt get used up is because T-Mobile started offering netflix for free so linked that account with T-Mobile and it was getting paid through T-Mobile. Slowly T-Mobile started charging extra for Netflix as the rates went up and currently it costs $4.50 paid through the T-Mobile bill. But even these charges were getting paid via T-Mobile bill. Netflix told me that the gift card will only get used when the account is billed directly by Netflix.  
  
  
The situation now is that we will be outside US for a year+ and I have no clue how to handle this. We are keeping our T-Mobile account to preserve the numbers and also for occasional phone use. But we don’t want to pay the extra $4.50 a month (seems like it is now going up to $8.50 a month even with T-Mobile subsidy). If I cancel the billing via T-Mobile, then it will become an independent account. But Netflix is telling me that there is no way to pause it from taking money from my GC balance every month. And if I cancel, then also I lose the GC balance. Any suggestions on what to do? Thanks",/r/Netflix Discord Server

Monty Python’s Flying Circus (1969-74):  
I grew up in a quiet village in south Oxfordshire. Television, with its three channels, was an escape. At various stages in my life I’ve enjoyed anarchic comedy shows such as Monty Python’s Flying Circus, The Young Ones and Chris Morris’s The Day Today, which mix satire and quite intelligent, angry comedy with stupid jokes.

RoboCop (1987):  
If I ever made a Black Mirror movie, I’d try to emulate RoboCop and The Truman Show. As with the latter, I’m much more interested in the scenario that the characters find themselves in than the minutiae of how it works. What’s frustrating is that I’ll often carry an idea for a Black Mirror episode around for a long time before I’ve worked out what the story is, but then sometimes, annoyingly, reality catches up",Charlie Brooker: I’ve only let my kids watch one episode of Black Mirror

157,"Every player should get a secret agenda that gives them an advantage for completing it or a disadvantage if they don't, regardless if they are the millionaire. Also voting the millionaire should reward you with extra money in the pot. A million added each time they get it right.","Million Dollar Secret: good idea, stupid execution"
158,"The whole thing breaks when people figure out that a basic alliance structure can steamroll to the end.

There is no point in voting out the millionaire until the final 2-3 people. Just find your core group and eliminate everyone else.

Like all of these shows, challenges are a snooze fest. It’d rather cut them entirely. 

Still a better premise than The Traitors. ","Million Dollar Secret: good idea, stupid execution"
159,"There are tons of issues with the show. The game portion is a joke because the trophy room clue gets instantly told to everyone, so who really cares about the games? Might as well skip it and go straight to voting since it matters so little.

The millionaire supposedly gets more powerful as the game goes on, but if everyone knows who it is and avoids contact and conversations, there's no way to complete agendas, game over.

A LOT of game theory and testing needed to be put into this before putting a million dollars on the line. As it stands, it's just not a very interesting show. I'll be surprised if it makes it to another season the way it is now.","Million Dollar Secret: good idea, stupid execution"

It's not a show for everyone but my partner and I loved it. It's one of our favorites ever.

I think the praise it gets indicates that more and more people have no taste whatsoever or are content with very little to chew on, it's a show that never challenges the viewer - you get what you see on screen and nothing else.

So no he didn't SA Katie, even thought he ""had the chance"" to do so.


Katie however you could say she was kinda SA when the other boy she liked shared her topless fotos with everyone else. (It is a criminal offence and since she was a minor if would have been distribution of C-P@#n too. I don't think it's legaly classed as SA, but it is imo especially if it's a minor).


Why they chose to have that word sprayed on Eddie's van? No idea. Maybe to show that once negatively in the spotlight some people will just say and do stupid things and target family members with ridiculous accusations. (Since what Jamie said at the interview in EP3 would have been completely confidential and never shared to the public). Or maybe it was ment to be a reference that Jamie killed Katie because ""he was a red pill incel"" and therefore had a sexist motive. (Which would totally ignore that Katie wasn't just the victim of being murder, she was also the mean offender of all the bullying on- and offline that actually led to her being killed, not Jamie being a sexist).",adolescence

And have very limited sympathy for Graham.  Switzerland to London is a quick flight.  He could have very easily flown back amid forth if need be.  What could he have possibly been doing for 2 months when his wife just gave birth.  

He almost started laughing when discussing  how his mum stole money from someone else, to fund the hotel stay in tower bridge.

In his home, his family and particularly his wife, would give him space and not do anything that may set him off when he was angry. The family was walking on eggshells around the dad and the pattern continued with Jamie. The mom said in the last episode they saw his anger and should have done more to help him manage it. 

When he confronted Katie she did the opposite of what his mom always did. Rather than be timid and give him space she confronted him directly and paid the price with her life.

405,"The series is very well done. It effectively shows how a combination of circumstances can cause a tragedy with an innocent child murdered and two families destroyed. 
She places herself on the side of the aggressor to better understand the causes.
It is not a question of excusing but of understanding and seeing where our individual and collective responsibility lies, and you have completely forgotten the 4th episode, the most important in my opinion.

1- social networks and the nauseating values ​​that sometimes emerge from them.
Need to control these networks for the health of people, especially minors. 

2- School bullying.  Vastly underestimated. 
Need to report and deal with all situations, to create help numbers, a referent in establishments, to not let things happen. Too many suicides because of that. 

3- the bankruptcy of teachers.  Our young people are more difficult than before.  Teachers are often overwhelmed by provocations and insubordination. They do not have enough staff and resources, nor training in de-escalation, to deal with these adolescents.  The one who greets the policeman is on the verge of collapse, the teacher expected in class doesn't care about anything, another has transformed into a soldier.  The establishment is hyper toxic and does not know how to manage all the suffering and violence of the kids. 

4- parents.  They are very nice, but completely dysfunctional.  The father has not overcome his childhood traumas, does not know how to manage his emotions, does not know how to express his affection with his children or with his wife.  
The mother is submissive and terrified.  She does not know how to manage her emotions better but in another register. She is pitiful. 
They should both have had psychotherapy. They didn't ask the son about his life in the college,  about his consommation with the net, they didn't give him love and confidence enough.

Result: a kid who doesn't know who he is, who lacks self-confidence, thinks he's ugly, is influenced by outdated man/woman images, no longer makes a difference between the virtual and reality (the girl isn't dead), has remained a baby so much that he believes it's a denial of something, this thing didn't happen (I didn't kill her).

412,"Streaming is different than network tv. 

On network tv shows are being filmed while they air. In general it takes about 8 days to complete an episode of your typical law and order type show. Post is editing while they film so by the time they are filming episode 8, episode 1 has aired on television.   Everything is much faster.  Network tv shows do not have a lot of cgi so post is easier

For shows on Netflix and other streaming platforms, they take about a year to complete from when prep starts and post finishes.  Sometimes they film in blocks which is filming parts of different episodes on the same day. Sometimes you have actor availability issues or it’s cheaper to film all scenes at a certain location.  It takes post longer to edit this way. 

Once the show airs, the studio has to decide if they are going to pick it up.  There is a good chance they have had writers on working on scripts for a potential season 2 but that isn’t always the case.  The process starts over again.  It will be a minimum of a year before season 2 airs. It could be longer for various reasons. I’ve worked on a show where a cast member was injured and we shut down for 8 months. I’ve been on shows that were delayed because of hurricanes.  The last show I was on filmed two episodes then there was the SAG and Writers strike. When they came back 6 months later they shut down again for script revisions. 

This is just a few reasons why it takes so long.",Why so long?
413,Keep making excuses about being ripped off it’s totally cool,Why so long?
414,"This is a very common question for many people if you Google it, lol.


It's mostly larger budgets, more complicated productions and show runners wanting more time. (Sometimes also scheduling of all the actors, since you don't want to swap out faces, that pisses people off even more)... covid and strikes used to cause delays but that's been years by now and it's no longer a valid argument.


But yeah it's annoying. There's some shows I was hooked at Season1 but when Season2 came around I lost all interest and/or there's just too many others good stuff I plan to watch first. I also think overproduction is a reason too... too many projects/ new series at once. That's why so much stuff gets cancelled even if a lot of people watched it.


But what's even worse than that is if they have actually completely finished the Season but split it in Seasons 3A and 3B and just don't publish what they already have... why? I am not going to watch half a Season and than wait months for the other half! It sucks so badly I'll boycott almost every series who does that shit. Especially if it isn't even broadcast on normal TV but an ""own production"" and there's absolutely no reason to justify it.",Why so long?
415,"Perhaps you haven't heard of a thing called the COVID 19 pandemic that affected the whole glob, then there were the dual strikes in Hollywood first with the writers, then the actors...",Why so long?

418,"Is Cara gonna win? She’s been so unnoticed, maybe that’s her trick. Others are too out there with their opinions. Sam is my favourite too",Million Dollar Secret EP 4-6 (SPOILERS!!!)
419,"So glad Chris is gone. He really thought he was so smart, and above everyone else. Not sure if it's a bit of direction from the producers or editing, but him acting like the household leader became insufferable. Then to straight up lie at the end about the Cara discussions, and interrupt constantly left a bad taste about his manners. This guy is no prince or even a gentleman for that matter. 

Felt the same way about Sam as you, and I'm genuinely really surprised at how good she played as the millionaire. Just wish she didn't mention anything about the lie detector and she would have been golden.

I really can't stand the hypocrite Jaimi. Hope she goes out next.

Sydnee is annoying, thinking she's god's gift to men. I did not even find her the prettiest on this show, but she sure believes she is. And then, how she loves to show off whatever achievements she's had comes across as really egotistical. Hope she's out soon too.

Really pulling for Cara. She came across as wholesome on this.

Thanks for the link to the podcast. Will listen.",Million Dollar Secret EP 4-6 (SPOILERS!!!)
420,"chris wasn't that bad but his comment about saving the princess and then getting stabbed didn't make sense since he never saved her... He thirsted for her but there was no saving ever. She and Phil said they vibe with each other but i took it as more of a friend/crush thing rather than them actually wanting to pursue each other. Chris was actually lusting over her but she was just alliance forming. She didn't ""play all the men"", only chris was entranced by her.",Million Dollar Secret EP 4-6 (SPOILERS!!!)
421,"I wasn't sure about Sam either than the way she pulled that group together to keep Lauren after she was the one that knew Lauren was the millionaire, it showed her character there. She makes sense, she understands why people do things for the game, she doesn't get indignant about it. It pissed me off how much Chris lied about putting Caras name out there to Sam. He most definitely was trying to put Caras name out there as a suspect because he didnt want Sam knowing he suspected her. And Sam knew it. He aggressively lied about it at the table and I felt he was trying to emotionally manipulate the table. He wouldn't even let Sydnee talk for herself. He was definitely losing his cool at the table. Corey annoyed me as well when he said now I have this agenda i have to do whatever it takes including lying to keep going, its part of the game. Why didn't he have that understanding for Lauren when she right from the start had to do those agendas. I knew that was going to happen as soon as he had any pressures of hiding a secret, anyone in that game has to be strategic about it for the game it doesn't make them a bad person. What makes them not so great is treating someone pretty bad when you find out they were playing the game, it makes no sense. A handful of that group does not know how to put themselves in someone elses shoes, they only look at how they are feeling at that moment, how it is affecting them only, its very short sighted",Million Dollar Secret EP 4-6 (SPOILERS!!!)
422,"My aunt and I cheered when Chris was eliminated out of the show. He was so annoying. He talked how he was not emotional and he's level headed but he did the opposite. Also the prince charming was weird

I also didn't care doe Sam but I am now rooting for her. 

I also laughed so hard when Lydia called out Jaimi saying she's ""shallow and pretentious"" 
because I agree.
I was rooting for Lydia's success but I hope that poker queen is doing well",Million Dollar Secret EP 4-6 (SPOILERS!!!)
423,Yay! Bye Chris! Did not like him as a player at all. Full of himself. Sam deserves the money- she's got the most brains of anyone left. Cara probably needs the money more than anyone else. How much do you earn flippin burgers? Kyle - not smart. What is he doing there? How did he get on the show? Corey - another not smart person. Sydnee - she's deserves the $$ too - they've been rough on her and she's managed to survive - Jaimi - ? I don't get her.,Million Dollar Secret EP 4-6 (SPOILERS!!!)
424,"I don't think Cara flips burgers. She seems too classy, probably comes from money.",Million Dollar Secret EP 4-6 (SPOILERS!!!)

I am so addicted to this show I end up planning to watch one episode and bingewatch the whole thing.

But I really want Cara to win. She seems so lovely.",Million Dollar Secret EP 4-6 (SPOILERS!!!)
426,"What was the deal with all those people being so mad at Lauren and accusing her of lying after she told them she was the secret millionaire? What’s she gonna do? Tell them that she’s the secret millionaire? These people are so dimwitted. Once she told them, they all turned on her. The whole game is about lying and deception. And then they’re wasting a vote to get her out? I didn’t even think she was that much of a threat. And the chances of her becoming a millionaire again, although they wouldn’t have known how the game really worked, would be very slim Unless at the end you’re somehow able to steal the million from somebody because once you would have the million I don’t see yet how you’re gonna get the million back because if they’re moving it around it’s not going to end up in your box again chances are. Jamie was like so rude to her And it’s such a joke that she’s a life coach. 🤣 I think I would go to a different coach personally.Sydnee think she’s God’s gift to the world. Totally glad Chris went home. I thought Chris was Dust when Sam had the killshot. I was really bummed that she sent a great character home instead of sending Chris or Sydney or Jamie home. I just can’t believe all three of them ganged up on Lauren for not admitting she was the millionaire. It was absolutely bonkers. If I could’ve reached through the TV and smacked all three of them back into lucidity I would have. Personally, this is one of my favorite reality game shows now. It’s very similar to the traitors. The only thing I don’t like about the show is that some of the clues they give them make it very easy to find out who the millionaire is. I hope they come up with a good way at the end to even out the playing field for the remaining players And this is one time when I really don’t care who wins as long as it’s not Sydney or Jamie. It’s very bingeable though. Can’t wait for season two.",Million Dollar Secret EP 4-6 (SPOILERS!!!)
427,"Came here to say that Chris’s self-importance really annoyed me too. So many times he highlighted his “amazing brain”, and how he should do all the riddles because of his, again, amazing brain. And everytime, I was like, well, it looks like others have amazing brains too AND work better together. That was certainly the case with the “creepy animals” challenge where the whole team apparently needed to witness him, in awe, crack those easy ass codes, thus making them loose because they were so slow. Also, in episode 5, he says at the elimination dinner: “I know not everyone is a film buff; I am”, referring to how this film-buffery led him to solve the “Scream” clue. Jesus Christ man, you don’t need to be a film buff to know Scream! Second, EVERYONE had figured out that clue! But no, leave it to the incredible movie encyclopedia to solve this difficult case, what would they do without him 😂. And Sam literally and loudly solved the clue on the spot. 

Speaking of Sam; I actually really liked her from the beginning, because she clocked that Lauren was the millionaire within what felt like two seconds, but no one listened and instead kept shouting out one unhinged guess after another (looking at you Corey, it was borderline hilarious to witness him being completely off in his guesses one episode after another). Sam is just so lazer sharp. Also, the way she and Cara were just: “he’s so whipped” about Chris 😂🎯. Chef’s kiss.",Million Dollar Secret EP 4-6 (SPOILERS!!!)

444,"The series is very well done. It effectively shows how a combination of circumstances can cause a tragedy with an innocent child murdered and two families destroyed. 
She places herself on the side of the aggressor to better understand the causes.
It is not a question of excusing but of understanding and seeing where our individual and collective responsibility lies.

1- social networks and the nauseating values ​​that sometimes emerge from them.
Need to control these networks for the health of people, particularly minors. I think that incel culture and masculinism is à big problem but not the only problem in the series. 

2- School bullying.  Vastly underestimated. 
Need to report and deal with all situations, create help numbers, a referent in establishments, so as not to let things happen. Too many suicides because of that. 

3- the bankruptcy of teachers.  Our young people are more difficult than before.  Teachers are often overwhelmed by provocations and insubordination. They don't have enough staff and resources, or de-escalation training, to deal with these teens.  The one who greets the policeman is on the verge of collapse, the teacher expected in class doesn't care about anything, another has transformed into a soldier.  The establishment is hyper toxic and does not know how to manage all the suffering and violence of children. 

4-parents.  They are very nice, but completely dysfunctional.  The father has not overcome his childhood traumas, does not know how to manage his emotions, does not know how to express his affection to his children or his wife.  
The mother is submissive and terrified.  She does not know how to manage her emotions better but in another register. She is pitiful. 
They both should have undergone psychotherapy. They didn't ask the son about his college life, about his Internet usage, they didn't give him enough love and trust.

Result: a kid who doesn't know who he is, who lacks self-confidence, thinks he's ugly, is influenced by outdated man/woman images, no longer knows the difference between the virtual and reality (the girl is not dead), has remained a baby so much that he believes it's a denial of something, this thing didn't happen (I didn't kill her). He is not a psychopath because he want to be loved, by the psychologist, by his father, ... he has a big lack of confidence,  which is not the case with psychopath.

Fortunately, there is a change in him and in the family at the end, after the father's outburst of violence, but the damage is done.",I just watched Adolescence twice in 48 hours. What is everyone's views on Jamie? (Flair: Discussion and Question)

446,"They're all just kids. 

Jamie was an insecure kid that was effectively brainwashed into having low self worth and a terrible view on women. When he called the incel redpiller's the ""truthers"", that's when you know that he was pretty far gone down that rabbit hole.

Katie was from what was being portrayed in the show, a bully. She too was feeling pretty low with her pictures being spread around, and she acted out. But the fact that (due to the show's logic about emoji colours which I don't think is actually a thing) she was bullying him online was no small part in pushing Jamie even further down the path he was going.

That's not to say it was her fault. It 100% lies on Jamie. But it's just a reminder that kids are cruel, but also some are easily swayed by the things they read online.

The third episode really shows how much hate he has towards women.",I just watched Adolescence twice in 48 hours. What is everyone's views on Jamie? (Flair: Discussion and Question)

563,"The show is entertaining but as noted has some key flaws. Namely it doesn’t really matter who you vote off and there’s no real benefit to hanging onto the money early. If they made it so successfully hanging onto to the money each vote gained you $10,000 or something vs giving extra money to those who identify the millionaire that would be interesting — maybe.

A few other dumb things early on for me were:

\- when everyone found out Lauren was the first millionaire they acted so offended she lied. it was an unforgivable sin.  this is completely stupid.  it’s literally the point of the show. it’s so absurd i feel like they had to have told people they’re required to act offended.

\- early on when Sam was so sure Lauren was the millionaire and ranting about it — they show in the vote tally she didn’t vote for Lauren (ep 2). This wasn’t a random tactic at the time — she claims her goal was to get the millionaire out yet she voted for Phil?

\- some episodes they don’t show you how the voting went - like why?

\- the show unfairly rigs things against the millionaire. the clues they randomly decide to share in the trophy room can be ridiculously detrimental. they aren’t always fair clues. The horror film title clue for example did Phil dirty.   


Then in general I wonder if they give the people parameters of what they can talk about amongst each other. Like these people could just grill each other for like 8 hours. I’m guessing they told the people they cannot do certain things throughout the day or maybe they are kept separate 98% of the time.

As I know this is the first season and maybe they'll change it later because I think it would be interesting for them to have like a little booby prize for voting for The Millionaire like,  you don't find out until the end of the game or you've been voted out, obviously, but every time you vote for the millionaire correctly you get $5,000, if there's eight elimination rounds in a season that's an opportunity to win $40,000 which isn't quit your job and move to Maui money, but it sure helps. ",Secret millionaire show

The reason is the advantages though. There's always a risk when you're not holding the money that the advantage might be too powerful.

Secondly his interactions with Katie may have pushed him over the edge, but it was hos views on women and the way his insecurities had been twisted into resentment that got him to the edge in the first place. Take that aspect away and this is a story about two teenagers talking shit to each other online and no one gets stabbed.",How is Adolescence about Toxic Masculinity?
581,"A few things, it’s not about standing up to a bully but being fueled by his own insecurities and also that a girl said no. Did you not see the episode 3 with the psychologist? She literally asked why he approached her when she wasn’t even his type. His answer was she was at her lowest and she couldn’t say no. Imagine a guy thinking that if a girl is at her lowest, she won’t say no to anything. But, she did. And what happened, he stabbed her to death. 

Why Andrew Tate was mentioned? Dude, that mf collectively started the “Alpha Male” “Sigma Male” movement. He literally fucking told that if your woman says no to you, you should choke her. Are people really dumb about how social media affects a young person’s ability to judge others and themselves? Social media plays a very large role in all of our lives. Whether we want to not. It’s very easy to get influenced by shit like that. 

Just because someone calls you an incel, doesn’t mean you can stab them. And let me make it clear, HE DID NOT STAB HER BECAUSE OF THE COMMENTS, HE STABBED HER BECAUSE SHE HAD THE AUDACITY TO NO EVEN WHEN SHE WAS AT HER LOWEST.

584,"I do agree that the treatment of toxic masculinity was nuanced. It wouldn't have been anywhere near as good a show otherwise. If we take him at his word, he's not a hardcore incel who listens to Andrew Tate etc, but someone who has absorbed that culture more diffusely at school and through his family's traditional gender norms and behaviours. In that version of events, he sort of accidentally ends up acting like an incel (asking the girl out when he perceives her as unvalued and vulnerable). The girl calls him out on this, and then he does the ultimate incel act of killing a girl who has rejected him. Also, this clearly wasn't a 'snap' thing as he brought the knife with him and followed her.

There's of course the other version of events where he's a through and through little psycho incel who puts on a convincing front of a sweet, smart, misunderstood boy 99% of the time.

587,"Jack Thorne has said directly that the show is about male rage - more specifically, how men and boys can act aggressively after rejection or poor self-esteem. It seems to fall into the bracket of what we understand as 'toxic masculinity', whatever you think of the term.

I agree however that the extent to which Jamie is suckered in by incel ideology is not that clear - in ep 3 he actually acknowledges some distance from it. As a piece of drama the show is amazing, but I do think it's a little bit non-committal on what exactly it is that has shaped Jamie's actions and thoughts - the show vaguely handwaves at 'the internet'.

As others have said, it isn’t particularly specific to Tate but the kid’s views had elements in common, magnified by his temper.

My main takeaway as a parent and human was how he was isolated from influences that might have diluted his horrid views.

590,"The kids are on Jamie’s side.

I watched this immediately when it came out bc of course I did. Tbh I found it a bit suffocating and somewhat slow and boring but ok. I have a teenage boy and we have a good relationship, which I’ve noticed is peculiar among his peers. He knows that too, and his friends reach out to me when they have life questions. I suppose I’m a trusted adult. They know I care, and listen, and don’t bullshit. 

Anywho, I nudged him to watch it before he’d heard of it and we both felt the answer is *not* banning kids on social media. We’ve talked about this show a lot as he was the first among kids his age to watch it. So he needed to process. 

But now he’s telling me they’ve watched it, and he’s chilled by the pro-Jamie stance flooding his feed. That Katie had it coming. That she was a bitch and a bully. These kids collectively are saying she deserved to die for some Insta comments. The kids are watching, and their takeaway is wild. I’m saying this as a concerned parent who sees everyone my age getting it wrong. They’re dying for guidance and to feel they belong which they should get at home. Instead they’re finding it where they can from people who sacrifice ethics for views. Or they just don’t have any ethics and don’t give a shit. And Jamie is the result if that. 

Jamie is not the outlier. Jamie is the norm. My kid is the outlier because we actually talk and spend time together. And he thinks this way of thinking is stupid immature bullshit. Which it is.

I’ve said over and over- it’s not the kids, it’s us who raised them. Or, who didn’t really and just coasted along with our faces in the phone. Too many of these kids have been ignored over and over again since before their earliest memories because their parents are faves into phones.

I never finished the second season but Dani irks me for a reason.

Her standards are incredibly high, with her self worth in the stratosphere BUT she basically only wants to be in a relationship with a career path adjacent to her own. There's nothing wrong to wanting similar goals in life. But this standard she has clouds her judgement and it just feels that she's looking for a business partner and not a romantic one. Or she's really just looking for networking connections as you would on LinkedIn.

She puts on an anime voice and it's kinda cringe. I bring this up, since I work in the world of voice over with anime and video game actors. They truly dislike people that come up to them and talk a game about how they do impressions and want to be in the industry but are also super arrogant. Arrogance is the important word here. They like answering questions about getting into the industry, but don't like people that read as ""leechy"" or ""know-it-all"".

James' parents enable him too much and yes I know he's on the spectrum, but he's not really endearing. It bothers my wife quite a bit.

Maybe the end of Season 2 is better. Maybe 3 fixed a bunch of the previous complaints. OR maybe Netflix is just taking advantage of these vulnerable people and profiting.

621,There is a saying. Dionne was robbing Peter to pay Paul. That’s how she stayed in those hotels and made friends with the staff. She paid and spun her millionaire story or she had those she tricked to pay.,Con Mum
622,This show blew my mind and I didn’t expect it to.,Con Mum
623,"I think it’s just the frustration because it seemed so obvious looking in. 

Dionne did not look like a healthy, wealthy woman. He never asked if you’re a woman of wealth and connections how was it possible I was even taken away from you. 

Wealthy people do not lose access to their money. How was his friend the only person that called this out? 

No one, even after 45 years apart, should be paying 300k+ for a gift. Even if you WERE wealthy. You work slowly on building a connection and I feel like Heather wanted to say that to him. It never occurred to them that she could have left him money without ever telling him and I feel like most returning parents would do that because you’d want the connection to be real. 

Heather did the right thing for her child and as sad as it is that Graham is absent, I actually think she’s keeping their son safe. This was very recent, it’s going to take time to heal. I also hope her fee from Netflix goes someway to replenishing what she had taken from her. ",Con Mum
624,"My pov is that you can think someone is behaving atrociously but also feel bad for them at the same time. Especially if part of the reason they are behaving so atrociously is connected to the reason you feel bad for them - here, the abuse and abandonment Graham suffered as a child.",Con Mum

the con mum was a blessing in disguise to heather...she was with a loser, and if she had realized that 3kids in....what a bigger disaster",Con Mum
626,"I found it annoying that at the end of the documentary, Graham was paying homage to his ""friends that stood by him"".  I don't remember the exact phrasing,  but it along the lines of ""you know who really is there for you"", etc.   To me, that was a slap in the face to Heather.   She was abandoned, left to care take their son alone and harmed financially, but it was only his friends that ""stood beside"" him.",Con Mum
627,"I dunno, it's not easy to imagine what it's like to have your mum abandon you, then come back years later, telling you she's only got 6 months to live.

Throwing in the emotional manipulation that any time he threatened to leave, she'd have a health downturn and/or grow frosty with him.

Having to choose between a short window to get to know his mum, I guess it can be easier to think you'd make it up to the son ""later"".

Not saying part of it probably wasn't greedy, based on how much money he expected to inherit, but I did still feel bad for the guy. The COVID rules at the time were pretty complicated, so going to New Zealand would have meant not being able to travel home at a moment's notice if his mum deteriorated suddenly. It was a pretty impossible choice.

I can't help but feel sorry for him, that his mum came back into his life purely to steal from him.",Con Mum
628,"I agree with you, Gordon was insufferable. What I noticed is how he had some characteristics like his mum and dad. He was just as greedy for money as his mum was, and he also hurt his family just as his dad did to him. It's incredible how the very same things he hates about his parents, he perpetuates himself. I don't feel sorry for him at all. He got what he deserved, pursuing the money relentlessly and enjoying the lavish lifestyle without caring about his pregnant wife and then newborn son back home. Many times, he would comment that he wanted to spend more time with his mother, but it really was just about getting the inheritance she promised him. I'm so glad that Heather left him also and moved closer to her family, I'm sure it was to surround herself with family to help raise her son. It was so incredibly selfish of him to also use their joint money and savings without her knowledge or consent to help secure the cars his mother promised him. He is materialistic, selfish, and greedy. It's so sad that those are the very same words you can use to describe his mother. It seems the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I hope he gets help with these emotional problems. He has huge abandonment issues and mother and father wounds that will make him vulnerable to some other scam if he doesn't get help and healing.",Con Mum
629,"I understand OP's point, but I'm going to be a devil's advocate and can believe he was manipulated due to the fact he never had a mum. Imagine being 45 and NEVER having an actual mom in your life. I don't know about you, but I can't fathom that because I've always had one. So there was this gaping hole and void, and suddenly it's filled. Furthermore, your mom is supposedly uber rich and is also dying. So now not only has this void filled, he's promised with hundreds of millions of dollars to forever change his family's (including his newborn) life massively. College for all four years to literally any university his kid wants? Paid up front. So there was a combination of not only a new person to fix the trauma in his head as well as a horizon of unbelievable wealth. His mom was dying (he thought). He finally gets to experience having a Mom after 45 years and it's being taken from him again. So there was a longing to experience all that he could before she was gone. I have a 3 year old son so I completely understand where you're coming from. I can't imagine abandoning my wife and kid for my Mom, but we also don't know the actual circumstances. However, after all said and done, I do feel like the end is soft of a realization. I was kind of hoping he would reconcile with his wife and she help him pick up the pieces. I felt it odd he just sort of gave up and said ""well guess I got some cool cooking buddies!"" as a replacement. Sounds like albeit Graham is a likeable guy, he doesn't have his priorities straight. Maybe they were having problems before and this mum nightmare was the straw that broke the camel's back.",Con Mum
630,I feel this isn’t PC but I’m bothered by how ugly she is I’m terms of her personality and style of talking and her gluttony and spending it makes me sick … I think her son didn’t want to leave her because he thought if she feels slighted she might not leave him the money … he didn’t fall far from the tree ,Con Mum

She asked for my SSN after knowing her for 3 weeks. Even at the very naive age of 22 I felt incredibly uncomfortable with that. I don’t know how I would have reacted if she had tried to sweep me off my feet like this woman did to Graham, but I can tell you it’s an awful mindfuck to find the person you’ve spent your entire life wondering about and then realizing they are manipulating you.  A year later she completed suicide after I had had a tough conversation with her to set some boundaries. It was truly awful and took me years to stop blaming myself. I know that it’s hard to understand why Graham did what he did but you just can’t even imagine how much this could fuck with your head.",Con Mum
632,"The thing that really struck me was that I did not see him express one jot of self reflection or remorse at how badly he'd let Heather down, and therefore also his son. To leave her with a newborn for TWO MONTHS was unforgiveable. To take money from their JOINT account without discussing it with her or even telling her is also completely unacceptable behaviour. I think he behaved very badly and he doesn't seem to take any accountability for that, so I have little sympathy for him.

so to use your analogy, yes it’s like how a bartender can be arrested for overserving if the patron ends up harming or killing someone, including themselves.

653,"Agree. I’d go further and say I think what a lot of people are missing is we as parents have a lot of influence, and it’s important we step up and actively engage with our kids, listen to them, do fun stuff, eat together, talk to them with respect and honesty. That’s how we inoculate them and empower them to live in this world. It’s active, not being passively “well-meaning.”

My teenage son thinks so too. He watched Adolescence. He tells me most of his friends seldom see or speak to their parents and they’re jealous of his home life. The kids follow me on Insta and have a little fan club group chat. Some of them reach out to me to ask questions about drugs, sex, relationships, where to get manicures. I’ve started folding some of them into our stuff because they’re starving for it. They all have “well-meaning” hard working parents. 

My son and I cook and eat dinner together every night, we do fun date night type stuff, we share movies and music and tv shows and talk about them. On Friday nights we all make or order pizza and do phone free “classic” movies everyone watches together, chosen on rotation. We make miniatures together. When he was little, I stopped and listened to him and paid attention to his silly bs as if it mattered. It mattered to him. And now he’s older and has a lifetime of me reinforcing that. Toxic masculinity, Andrew Tate, none of that holds any interest for him. 

The parents need to put down their fucking phones. These teens were babies and toddlers when smartphones came out. I saw over and over again a parent with their face in a phone when the toddler would bring them a flower or a pretty rock at the park. That sort of thing. The kid would drop whatever they’d brought over and slink away. Broke my fucking heart, over and over again.

673,"My 13 year old son was born with hearing loss caught by UK newborn screening. My husband and I sought out the best for him, which was easy as the NHS  provided tremendous support, including initial MRI, genetic tests and vision screening and would include regular audiology tests and email responses from his hearing doctor at midnight, free hearing aids and regular visits to our home and then to his mainstream school by teachers for the deaf. He had an incredible community of support.
In 2017, a British soap actress with no knowledge of or research into childhood hearing loss made a film called The Silent Child, where she starred as a miracle worker to a child born with hearing loss in the UK who lacked support from her parents, doctors and schools. It was totally inaccurate and inappropriate. But it was treated as tue. It won an Oscar!
Now Adolescence is being treated as an accurate depiction of the lives of our British teens. It's not! It was written by a Gen X actor. To me, episode 3 is an exploration of the national haunting of Venables.
It's not a documentary of life of UK teens. Give them more credit. Our parents were worried about us too. They're doing pretty well. Don't treat one actor's fiction as fact to be shown in schools.

682,"I hadn’t read anything about it beforehand, nor watched any reviews or videos. I just dove straight into the series.

I was left with a strong impression regarding the theme of misogyny, and I’m curious if anyone else felt the same. I thought the series approached it subtly, almost like a subtext. I get the sense that many parents of teenagers, those who work hard and try their best to raise their kids but aren’t really connected to the digital world might interpret the series as being mainly about bullying. But to me, that’s clearly not the core issue.

In fact, I think that less informed viewers are likely to focus on the bullying aspect and miss the deeper message. The real problem is much more complex, it lies in silent radicalization, ingrained misogyny, emotional neglect, and the influence of the manosphere on vulnerable teenagers.

I also felt there was a noticeable lack of communication between parents and children in the story even a lack of presence. The parental figures came across as mere authority figures, and the kids were either obedient or rebellious, but there was no real connection or dialogue. There was no listening, no involvement. I just a failing model of control.

For people unfamiliar with terms like red pill, toxic masculinity, or the subtle ways young boys are being radicalized online, the show might come across as a surface-level drama when in fact, it’s highlighting something much more disturbing.",I just finished the Adolescence

684,"The boy who plays Jamie was fantastic. Chilling in his he could go from sweet and innocent, to flirty and charismatic in a very grown up way, to childish/brat like, to so angry/aggressive that he appeared an absolute threat to those around him. Adults often see children and teenagers as innocent and incapable of the kinds of harm adults cause, but children regularly commit some of the most serious sexual and violent crimes. I thought 

Something that really struck me was how adults in the series so often responded to teenagers using power, aggression and dominance. In the school teachers were often being militant, shouting at the kids, the entire thing was a constant power struggle. This power struggle is exactly how I remember state schools. It’s clearly not effective though, teachers can’t dominate teenagers into behaving. I agree with the observation of the police officer, that these schools often act more like a holding cell than an education centre. 

It does make one think, if we’re teaching boys with raging testosterone that the stronger and more powerful should dominate those weaker than them using aggression, then the idea of men dominating/punishing women may seem more normalised, and hold appeal as a way to release aggression and get what they want from them (sex, attention etc). 

I noticed this same pattern of power play in the psychologist assessment. As someone who works in psychology, I did not think the psychologist was behaving appropriately or like a psychologist. A feeling shared by my colleagues. My experience of psychologists is they are very good at defusing the situation and working with the individual. We’re taught to see violence/aggression as a symptom to be understood, not battled with. I’ve worked with similar patient groups, and to me she came across as very judgemental while lacking transparency. She really seemed like she was playing mind games.",I just finished the Adolescence
685,"I saw an interesting interview with the creator, where he was saying he didn't want to write a trope like an alcoholic mom or violent dad, or anything that would ""explain"" why Jamie was the way he was.

686,"I love this show. I think they did an excellent job on the last episode, they detailed something that we rarely see in media. They show how women carry the emotional labor in a relationship and family, how we’ve been conditioned to make sure we keep the peace. That one scene when the mom closes the door after they’ve come back from the store, how quietly she loses it. And how fast she “gets over it” and then goes to check on everyone else but did anyone check on her? 

I think, well I firmly believe that boys have been emotionally neglected by society and people while they grow up. They’re expected to act a certain way and when they misbehave it’s either boys being boys or they deem them too damaged and a lost cause.

I also believe that anyone who came from the series with the idea that Jamie deserved no sympathy absolutely didn’t get the point of the series. Jamie was a talented kid who just wanted love and acceptance. Yet he was ridiculed on a daily basis, which made his insecurities worse and pushed him towards these dangerous views. The therapist scene was incredibly powerful as it showed how behind his façade of misogyny and hate there was a boy who needed love.

695,I wished the show showed more of that radicalisation process Jamie got through. I wish they showed more of why it isn’t the girls fault that she send nude pictures and got murdered. The numbers of crimes and violence against women raises every freaking second. I wish for a show that screams in your face and shows how young boys are being radicalised and grow their hate against women.

I know a lot of kids who think the last two episodes were boring, but I thought they were so well produced, so well acted out. If we get a season 2, as people are talking about, I hope they change the narrative and have Jamie take his own life instead, or have Katie fight back and take his and see what conversations those spark, because as a female again still in school, I think it is so important to have this representation these topics are real and unfortunately riddled through our schools, I mean I'm in Australia and so many of the things pointed out in their school can be seen in mine.",I just finished the Adolescence

711,"Totally agree with you, I have an 11 year old myself and as a parent with children around this age I found it grueling to watch. Grueling because of how true to life it feels. 

I also really appreciate the perspective on this boy’s family background because both parents are present. Dad wasn’t perfect, but I didn’t find him egregiously horrible or anything and same for mom. 

So this is (to me) a nature vs nurture aspect and I think it’s harder to digest in some ways when that’s the case because there’s not a “smoking gun” to point out about why their son was holding so much rage. 

I think this show really just underscores how important it is for us as parents to try to foster rapport with our children so they feel safe sharing who they are and what’s going on with them. I also feel like it highlights how much the constant scrutiny of social media is causing potential harm and twisting childhood into a nightmare minefield of influence for kids today. ",I just finished the Adolescence

The problem I see here is that it is just seen as another statement from mainly the left on the problems of masculinity with of course no statement on how to fix any of it, which is par for the course. This topic has been discussed ad nauseam for years about the manosphere and toxic masculinity but as usual there is never even ever a hint of a solution. Just a bunch of hand wringing. So while the writer and director want to make something to start the conversation I am laughing because this conversation has been going on for probably at least the last decade and this series is just another drop in the pond which will result in nothing more than more angst and hand wringing.",I just finished the Adolescence

I wanted more info into Jamie and how his parents didn’t see the signs that he’s clearly a psychopath. I feel like going down the internet rabbit hole of toxic masculinity wouldn’t cause an otherwise normal kid to resort to murder. Especially because we see that Jamie is manipulating and calculated in episode 3. There’s no way that kid is that messed up and there wouldn’t have been some kind of signs. Hurting animals, crazy outbursts or no emotions at all, just something.

730,"I had a slightly different reaction than some people I think… I wanted to know through the whole movie what Katie did to him, not because I “skew all blame” towards the females, but because I know some very unkind teen girls.  From the beginning I felt sorry for Jaime until he got really angry and vicious toward the psychiatrist.  It’s because I have seen “mean girls” push someone to the edge with badgering cruelty then freak out when the usually calm, quiet, diminutive victim finally lashes back at them, then they point at them and say “Did you see that?!”, “They are crazy!”.  No, it’s called reactive behavior… Not even reactive abuse, as some have called it, but reactive behavior, much closer to self defense. By the end I saw it didn’t seem to be as bad as Jaime projected it to be, not that anyone should be killed for it, but I still wondered how far Katie had gone to torture this boy that would make him want to kill her., Just me…",I just finished the Adolescence

In the end I don't think it's sustainable. They are already running out of ""new"" members as most homes in the US are already members.

779,"The message for me was that these girls mattered, no matter what their profession was. They were brutally murdered and deserved justice. I also appreciated getting the perspective of their loved ones. As others have said it humanizes them, when all we know of them is static photos. 

Unfortunately for them, the Suffolk County police chief and DA were too busy running a crime syndicate and trying to keep their own out of prison that this case just wasn’t important enough for them to give it the time and attention it deserved. Jimmy Burke would hire prostitutes himself so he likely had a low opinion of these women as well.  

They ignored witness reports, key clues (his truck and physical description being the most obvious - very low-hanging fruit), and obvious connections in the cases over the years (which police bizarrely refuted), as well as blocking FBI involvement and not collaborating with the sex worker community and others that could have helped them solve this and stop this man years earlier. They could have saved lives. 

There was also the fact that the murderer was so meticulous and made slight adjustments as time passed. Serial killers usually have a pattern, and he was no different, but he did start to change the way he would do things over time.

again i get it, this doc was about shannan and the other victims, sarah's situation is something else entirely, but to have so many clips of mari, and so many interviews with everyone else who was in them, pictures of the whole family including mari and sarah, and then just casually mention that she and another mom ""passed away,"" in the same sentence, without saying anything else about what happened to her, really rubbed me the wrong way

to be fair, i'm local to the case and second screened it while working, so if there was text on the screen in E1-2 i might have missed it, but i really don't think there was there and there definitely wasn't at the end of E3 when they mentioned that she ""passed away""

They can’t harass Jamie because he’s in a secure institution, so the next best thing they can do to express their rage is harass his family. That’s really all there is to read into there. 

It’s really clear throughout the series that his parents are, in fact, good and normal people who are more shocked than anyone at the crime their son committed. 

The dad has a short fuse, like many men, but he’s obviously not a criminal. His urgency to paint the van is because he doesn’t need one more thing constantly reminding him of what his son has done; he’s haunted by it.",Adolescence. Episode 4 question (SPOILERS)

…great because it focuses on the victims and their families. I would have stayed engaged if they expanded on the related experiences of the families into a couple more episodes…and left the true crime stuff as is.

Bizarre how RH never did any improvements to his home. Particularly weird that he grew up in that house too. Ostensibly, he owned it outright, and made a decent living? What a dilapidated POS house.

I'm also not sure if it was within that documentary or elsewhere...but I listened to the full audio of the events of that day... which is quite gruesome & shocking to listen to

I assume most people know what it is, but i'm not going to give too many details for anybody that doesn't know.
I had already known the story and had known a lot of details about it already.... But for some reason this time after watching this documentary ( it was really more like a recreation of events as opposed to a documentary)... I ended up doing a deep dive for 2 days afterwards, finding both written & video interviews... and finding personal stories of people who were involved.  Finding out more information about his sons and the people who were in Guyana vs Georgetown. Just a really, really deep dive into various people who were either there or related to somebody there...and their personal connection to the events and the lead up to the events.

So to answer your question, it really stuck with me to the point where for days afterwards I was engrossed in researching more & more about it.  Including looking at numerous AWFUL photos.
It is very dark & tragic but I couldn't stop trying to learn more (this go around).

I know a lot of people are recommending adolescence and I understand why but it didn't hit any chords with me. The filming format didn't work with the message attempting to be told.
In other words, a lot of the message was overlooked bc of the one shot way it was filmed... leaving many questions and making it difficult to ""connect""

1271,"The motive is actually very clear, he kills her because she rejects him.",Adolescence: Can someone elaborate on the incel isse?
1272,"Another clue about his hatred of women is the comments he left on women's IG posts which we never see as an audience but it sounds like there might have been some suggestion of violence there. Also when he phones his dad in the last episode he hangs up when he realises his mum is also there. He loves his dad but seemed to have minimal fondness for his mum, I think at one point he says the best thing about her is she can cook a good roast dinner (someone correct me if I've misremembered).

I enjoyed the series very much but would have liked one more episode perhaps from Katie's friend's perspective to give us more of an idea about what Katie's circle/family were thinking, but I suppose the lack of clarity around a motive is part of the story, as in real life we are left with fragments of clues and have to piece things together.",Adolescence: Can someone elaborate on the incel isse?
1273,"Incel gets handled about a lot because it's a recognisable term but I think in sime of the analysis its misused. It's more the blanket of toxic masculinity and misogyny that it's exploring, of which incels are a sub set.


But I think the show goes out it's way to show that while his interactions with Katie made her the focus of hos anger and resentment, that if she wasn't on tbe scene then eventually it would have been another girl he targeted. The third episode makes very clear that his views on women and relationships in general are pretty messed up (beyond the usual levels of maturity you'd expect from a 13 year old) and he was full of anger, resentment and insecurity he didn't know how to process. Things that can be twisted and weaponised by bad faith players who want to push kids into extremism.


This absolutely wasn't him just having a problem with Katie, he very clearly had developed problematic views on women, and it's suggested he (and to am extent his peers) formed those through online manosphete influencers.",Adolescence: Can someone elaborate on the incel isse?
1274,"First of all- expressing anger and rage against men does not mean that he has no beliefs about women. It’s perfectly possible to have objectifying beliefs about women and still express anger toward men on occasion, but the beliefs driving them might be somewhat different, or overlapping but not identical. 

In regard to the point about misogyny and incel culture - the core issue at hand is beliefs about entitlement to sexual access to women (ie its unfair if denied), objectifying women as status objects and the consequential shame ans rage that comes from sexual rejection. Incel culture pushes and validates these things, but it’s only the latest cultural variant to do so. The point of Adolescence isn’t that Jamie is deeply involved in incel culture, it’s that these beliefs are swirling around him from his peers and online, giving him particular views about what he “should” be acquiring, and how to feel if he isn’t.",Adolescence: Can someone elaborate on the incel isse?

The police don't pick up on it either, until the detectives son points out the emojis don't mean what he'd assumed. And the questions and responses in the third episode are all pointing that way too. It's definitely subtle, but it's supposed to be. These are influences parents likely woudn't even notice.

It's worth noting the adults aren't calling him an incel, obviously that's ridiculous. It's what girls are school called him, but not in a literal sense, they're taking the piss. He's then turned to manosphere influencers who have put the ideas in his head.",Adolescence: Can someone elaborate on the incel isse?
1276,"There is a subtle undertone that I picked up on in the third episode.  I have heard the saying, “some men love women, but don’t actually *like* women”.  This is what an incel is to me.  

It In the third episode he says he is attracted to women (sexually, so he “loves” women).  But, she asks him if his dad talks to other women.  At first he says NO! Like his dad would never cheat.  She clarifies and says “no, I mean as friends” and his response turns to disgusted and says no.  She asks him about taking a girl he likes on a date and where would they go and what would they talk about.  He has no good response.  It becomes clear women are sexual to him and not people worth knowing otherwise.  There’s other examples in this episode as well.

I think where you lay on that spectrum is down to a balance of nature and nurture.

In Jamie's case, I personally think nurture took a bigger part in it.

Anyone that feels like it was the therapists job to deescalate/ redirect things is thinking and assuming therapy (even though this very clearly wasn’t therapy) is all about making the client feel good. That is not always what therapy is about. She was confronting him with things he had said and holding up a mirror to his words. If that’s too difficult to tolerate, and he was her psychotherapy client for talk therapy she probably would have backed down because most people don’t want to see a therapist that is challenging them like that. However because he was essentially mandated bc he was in custody, he didn’t have any choice and her goal was to understand his behaviors. It wasn’t to make him feel comfortable. Ultimately if this child ever wants to get better he will need to acknowledge everything the therapist brought to his attention. It’s very clear at the time Jamie still seems himself as a victim and is unwilling to take responsibility for his actions. She was very professional and very obviously torn up about the intensity of sitting in front of a child who has been radicalized in such a drastic way.

1358,"That’s the whole point of his character I felt. The show is highlighting the parallels between Jamie and Adam (the detectives son) we see Adam getting bullied at school and no one does much, we learn Jamie and his friends were bullied. We see that Adam and his dad are not super close and struggle to relate, we learn Jamie’s dad was out working a lot and ashamed when he did bad at sports. I think Adam is there to show another young man in some similar situations but he doesn’t go down the route that Jamie does. It can happen to almost any kid if you’re not careful and paying attention. Adam’s dad starts to course correct and realizes he is very out of the loop with his kids life and his relationship with his son isn’t great. He decides to change that. I think the relationship between Adam and his dad is there to be a parallel to Jamie and his dad and to try to show parents you need to step in before an Adam can become a Jamie or a Jamie becomes a Jamie. There are good kids that are falling into things they never should because something that’s not being attended to is causing that. That thing could be a number of things and I love that the show doesn’t fully point the finger at one thing that made Jamie do what he did. It asks viewers to look at their parenting, schools to look at how they are run and handle things, it looks at social media, it looks at ways kids can be influenced or radicalized or indoctrinated right under your nose. I think it was really important and powerful that Jamie was an every kid, he didn’t have some deep trauma or horrific thing happen to him, he didn’t have awful parents or an addiction or a severe mental health diagnosis. He was just a kid that through probably a bunch of little things ended up falling into an awful part of the internet and ruined so many lives with his actions.","Adolescence, detective did what more parents should do."

1367,"The cop makes the least amount of effort to get to know his son. 

He didn’t see anything about the incel stuff. His son is literally trying to tell him and just asks for room to breathe and talk, and yet the cop won’t shut up for five seconds to let his son gather his thoughts and talk. His son literally can explain the motive and what the cops are missing, but the cop never lets his son actually have the floor to just talk.

The chips part was, IMO the bare minimum attempt to do anything. It’s not a dialogue or an attempt to heal. It’s just a way for the cop to maybe feel like he hasn’t completely ignored his son once he’s realized how awful some of these other students are. 

Although I do see both perspectives of it - that maybe the viewer is supposed to believe the cop had this big momentous shift. If that’s the case though, I wish they had expanded on it slightly more.

However, my own take is that none of the “bad actors” are supposed to have a redemption arc. It’s just supposed to explain their shortcomings, and then end episode, start the next with a new bad actor. None of the other groups (school, psychologist, parents) have that same moment of repairing their character.","Adolescence, detective did what more parents should do."
1368,"He seemed way too slow to understand his son given he's supposed to be an intelligent detective. I also thought he was impatient with his son even though his son was giving him obviously valuable insight, so that reaction made no sense to me.

The detective didn't see Sh\*t and what he did see was completely wrong.

This son is 2 years older than Jamie and friends.

His son pulled him aside and told him what was going on after seeing him embarrass himself infront of his class.

He didn't do what more parents should do. For 1 most parents are already connected to their children. His kid telling him what the instagram messages meant was the longest conversation theyve had for a long time.

If anything his kid who was also bullied was at far greater risk at committing the crime than Jamie who seems to have a much more loving family. His kid was just less off a piece of sh\*t.","Adolescence, detective did what more parents should do."

The story was intriguing, but the filmmaking was really poor because nobody did any research on that woman. Like how did she get into the bank or what exactly did she con that couple for? Everything was super up in the air and I really hated it. 
That stuff needs more research and clarity. 
Also, Graham was portrayed as the victim while honestly he should’ve been called out more for leaving his family behind. Why is nobody talking about that? Yes he did have a shitty childhood. I get it but that’s not an excuse for not putting your family first especially if you just had a baby.

1423,"There WASN’T bullying. It’s amazing and so telling that this is what people are taking away from the show. The endless, endless chances and empathy towards problematic boys and men is astounding. He KILLED a girl, ended her life forever- no, it’s wasn’t about *him* being a victim. SHE was the victim.

There was no bullying. What happened was the detective was at school searching for a motive in ep 2. His son then approaches him and shows him Katie’s IG comments pointing out Jamie is an incel and everyone knows. The son is trying to explain his motive is that he has all these awful ideas about girls/women in his head. His dad isn’t familiar with incel/manosphere ideology though and he jumps straight to “oh, so she was bullying him!” His son even says “no, you don’t get it.” His son wasn’t alluding to bullying, that’s something the *detective* jumped to, because bullying made sense to him, all the other stuff did not.

The son walks away from the convo disappointed because his dad didn’t get his point about Jamie having warped misogynistic views.

Katie’s topless pics were passed around against her consent- THAT is bullying. Jamie then asked her out because she was at a low and therefore he thought she should feel grateful to be asked out- THAT is gross. Jamie then doesn’t react well to being rejected.

On top of this, we already know Jamie leaves “aggressive” comments on IG models’ pics.

Katie is literally just calling him out on incel behavior, as many would. It’s not bullying.

The bullying is in Jamie’s head and the detective’s. And the audience’s because most people think just like those boys/men. Very telling.","Is it me, or is the Incel culture / “the manosphere” aspect of Adolescent being massively over stated? It did touch on those issues, but it was more about a young lad with extreme anger issues wasn’t it?"
1424,"I don't necessarily think it was overstated, it was clear that his views about himself and girls etc were incel like, but then I also think that he had something else wrong with him, that he wasn't right in the head....but then for say psychopaths as far as I'm aware, there are crucial states of development where  if they experience something negative in that stage or say they are exposed to the incel culture they are far more likely to take a dark path.

I don't think it was really clear whether there was any 'bullying' or not, he was called an incel, but he *was* an incel, so I'm wondering if he was perhaps stating incel views and he was being called an incel for that reason, more like he was being called out for it rather than being bullied.","Is it me, or is the Incel culture / “the manosphere” aspect of Adolescent being massively over stated?

1425,"The core issue is about the entitlement that men and boys feel towards women and girls, and the devastating consequences that can occur when that entitlement is challenged or not secured. Sexual rejection has come to acquire a deeply shameful connotation and incel culture perpetuates that. So in a sense you’re right- Jamie was driven by anger born from feeling shamed- but anger and its expression are culturally mediated and unfortunately incel ideology is facilitating its expression. It’s not the only ideology that does so, but it is one of them.","Is it me, or is the Incel culture / “the manosphere” aspect of Adolescent being massively over stated?

I totally got the point of the show and the important and relevant message but as a showpiece it didn't hit and some things just did not work for me, especially in episode 3.

The way it was shot was innovative but also contributed to the sluggishness and even though I loved the first episode I said when it ended I would probably only watch the series once because of the way it was shot.

If there wasn't such hype I wouldn't have been so stunned at how it actually was. Not terrible by any means, but not close to being top tier.

Concerning your take OP, while the show was definitely more social commentary than narrative, it did need more narrative especially around why Jamie did what he did. He stabbed the girl like a bad guy from an 80s horror movie, truly psychotic. That he watched Andrew Tate, etc unchecked does not explain that well enough.

1504,"I don't think the point of the story is that Graham is a bad husband and father. The point of the story is that if it's too good to be true, it probably isn't true. 

People feel sorry for Graham, they don't praise him. It is heartbreaking that it was his own mother that conned him. And that the only reason she reached out to him in 45 years is because she needed a new victim. It’s just pure evil. 

Don't forget, he was the most vulnerable to her spell. He was the one who never had that parental support system growing up and that he believed he had only a short time to love and spend time with her. Remember, his wife was under the spell too for a while, and she accepted the money when she thought it was free. It wasn't until the money started leaving her bank account ***and she was no longer directly being manipulated by Dionne*** that she started questioning things. Graham was being manipulated every day by his mom because she didn't let him go. She no longer needed his wife to believe her because she had separated them from eachother. So she stopped manipulating the wife and focused on her son. She only needed Graham. And remember, he was the most emotionally attached to her, so if anything it is easier to believe why he would fall for her con.  People who were not emotionally attached to his mom, like his friend and some business consultants, still fell for her ruse and gave her thousands of dollars. 

I'm not saying all this to make his wife and friends sound dumb or greedy. They are not. I'm saying that his mom was an expert con artist and that anyone can fall prey to an elaborate con. 

Anyway, his wife did the right thing. I mean you can love someone but the damage is done. She can't trust him anymore and even if she did, maybe she can't forgive him. I hope that he is able to step up in the future and be the parent that his mom wasn't.",Con Mum – Graham is not as great as people make him out to be.

I agree that he was likely seeing dollar signs which aided in his poor decisions but no doubt his wife was too before Dionne started acting funny towards her. 
Graham will prob never be able to maintain an intimate relationship b/c his parents did not show him love, only abuse & manipulation. He cannot give another person unconditional love if he doesn’t know what that looks like. 
His wife has to deal with betrayal -not her ex sleeping around but them prioritizing their family over her and her son. I can’t imagine how you can enter another relationship with that weight.

1581,"Ok so I guess we are used to seeing troubled children come from abusive violent angry fathers. 

What is portrayed in Adolescence is a disconnect between a son and a father. (I.e. the football story from both of their perspectives )The series tries quite hard to show that many other elements contributed to what the boy did. However it does hit home that the parents did not know much about the child’s online life. 

It can be very hard to relate to a teenage child. 

That’s what is so sweet and heart wrenching about the last episode.

1582,The son joked about him tearing down a shed so that's to give a glimpse into his character. I think that you're confused is what makes the show brilliant. It delves into what may seem like normal behavior to some and or to others. It also asks us to question what we think is toxic or abusive. It doesn't always have to be over the top physical or extremely verbal. By sharing how he tore down the shed we can guesstimate what the me normal was in that house and how that combined with Jaime  wing radicalizes on the internet les to what happened.,Question about “Adolescence”: Are we supposed to view the dad as toxic or abusive?
1583,"I don't think the father is abusive BUT I do think he himself is a victim of toxic masculinity. When Jamie tells us that his father never hit his mother, but was once so angry that he destroyed a shed - that's not normal. 

And I don't think he's inherently to blame for that, but I think it's a good example of how difficult it is for some men, because of societal pressure, to express emotions in a healthy way. The father clearly sees himself as the strong man of the house - he's the one who brings in the paycheck, as we see in the last episode and the way he panics with the vandalism to his vehicle.

I liked this article, which doesn't go far enough I'd say, but does explain that one of the issues raised by Adolescence is the communication problem between fathers and their children.

1586,"So this is the way I took it. I don’t have exact quotes but this is how I remember it. In episode 3, Jamie explains to the psychologist that his dad is your typical manly man, which is something Jamie does not describe himself as. I took it as Jamie felt he could not live up to his dad’s expectations in that manner. One thing that is very common in the real world is fathers yearning to live vicariously through their sons. If Jamie is more “nerdy” or enjoys video games, his dad likely projects some sort of disappointment in him not being athletic and “manly.” This doesn’t make his dad a bad person and it’s not the sole reason Jamie ends up having mental/self esteem issues that lead him to commit murder. It’s more of a single cog in the greater machine of it all. I found it to be extremely accurate to how many fathers treat their sons. They arent a bad person or abusive. It’s just they have an expectation of their son(s) to live a certain lifestyle that their son(s) do not wish to participate in.",Question about “Adolescence”: Are we supposed to view the dad as toxic or abusive?

1589,"I didn’t view the Dad as toxic, I found him incredibly relatable. He was devastated that his son could do something like this. The last episode where both husband and wife were talking about how this could have happened and what could they have done differently was a masterpiece in parental emotions. 

I feel like it also showed that even though Eddie tried to break the generational trauma that he went through and wanting to never be like his Dad - showed that he was an active Dad until he started working more. He even encouraged Jaimie’s interest in Art. He wasn’t an example of toxic masculinity, he loved and respected his wife. Yes, he did have a temper and some anger issues, but that’s from unresolved trauma due to an abusive childhood - not because he hates women. 

I think that’s another reason why Jaimie kept lying even though it was obvious that he did it, because he knew his Dad would never have done something like what he did. Why, he wanted the Psychologist to tell his Dad that he didn’t do it, that he was an ok kid. He never wanted to loose respect in his Dads eyes - because he knew his Dad was a great role model. 

I also don’t like the take of blaming Red Pill content, the “bullying” he was getting from Katie and toxic masculinity for all of Jaime’s issues. There’s a deep down underlying Anger that Jaimie has, whether is genetic or stems from other mental health issues is another thing. His mom touched on it in the last episode that he had a temper and even compared it to Eddie - “you have a temper too, but not like that.”

1594,"I didn't get that takeaway. The dad was(is) basically the opposite of an incel. The stuff his son was thinking about & going through never even occurred to the dad. The dad & the mom  probably felt they should have been more present & involved with their son so they could prevent this type of low self-esteem incel mentality to take hold. I don't think the dad caused the son to think that way. I didn't see the dad as toxic at all, just normal. I feel like they showed it with the cop too. His eyes were opened by this case & he figured out he needs to start connecting with his son in a real way because the internet is eating these boys up at a rapid rate",Question about “Adolescence”: Are we supposed to view the dad as toxic or abusive?
1595,"I appreciate how the dad was trying not to be violence like his dad and I see him as a loving dad. But he (and the world) definitely contributes to Jamie's view about gender and his anger issues.

The way the dad was shutting down the mother few times is showing how he doesn't respect his wife as a person and as a partner. The mom is a supporting role, not a partner. Sure he loves her and cares about her, but not respect enough to actually listen.

This might influence how Jamie feels about women. How he feels that his mom is only good at making chicken roast or something, how entitled he is to a woman responding when he said he is ugly, or how acceptable it is to share nudes of his friends.

I understand that the dad's behavior might seem normal to some (or most) of people and I think that's also part of the problem. Jamie can be a victim and a murderer. The dad can be loving, trying his best despite his upbringing, and still in the wrong. It's tough to be a parent.",Question about “Adolescence”: Are we supposed to view the dad as toxic or abusive?
1596,I’m amazed how many see the dad as normal. He had huge anger issues! Please.,Question about “Adolescence”: Are we supposed to view the dad as toxic or abusive?
1597,"I feel like it's both. I think the family is supposed to be pretty typical. Still, at the same time, I do think the show is commenting on how different life strains can cause a parent to be frustrated, short, emotionally unavailable, and even abusive. Like the scene at the paint store, where he crashes out. Of course, as viewers, we understand, but ultimately, that is abusive behavior.

1598,"We’re supposed to view his father as a highly volatile and reactive man who can’t control his temper. These are character flaws that his son inherited from him. 

Maybe not directly abusive. But do you think his behavior is appropriate or acceptable? Do you think children should be around or learn from this type of behavior?",Question about “Adolescence”: Are we supposed to view the dad as toxic or abusive?

1603,"I disagree. If they mentioned checking his phone periodically then should they also mention having parental blocks on his computer, or talking to him about radicalism or any of the other things that may have stopped him from doing what he did? That would be a discussion that they would be having over the following weeks/months/years. I don’t think it needed to be specifically addressed. The mention that they should have done better implies that they were naive and should have been more aware.",Disappointed in Adolescence ending
1604,"I don’t think there’s a “right” way to address the issue just yet. The rise of social media, incel culture and the manosphere is still super new for parents to navigate. Yes, periodically checking your child’s phone might help address it, but it could also have adverse effects too. I think the main objective of Adolescence is to bring awareness to what teens experience and to get people talking about it with their kids.",Disappointed in Adolescence ending
